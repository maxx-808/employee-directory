## Description:

Homework 19: create a react app that takes an object array of "employees" and create a table to allow the user to look through them. have a way to sort and a way to filter array as well. For my app, there is a sort by gender, last name and a filter by work exp in company. Deploying a react app to github and getting a deployable link working was hard, I had to edit and change things as well as do a new repo and react-app 3 or 4 times, the instructions given were different then the ones I used to solve this problem

## Photos of Application:
landing page, this is where the api call happens and sends state to local storage to keep the same data through the pages

when you want to use a new set of random employees, it will delete localstorage, showing this page to not throw errors for mapping and sorting.
click refresh and it will bring new people in
